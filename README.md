# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction 🩺  

This is my **first machine learning project**, where I built a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease with **98% accuracy**! Using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), this project demonstrates the power of data science and machine learning in healthcare applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical and lifestyle attributes.  
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, containing features like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.  
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive **98% accuracy** during evaluation.  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Feature selection and scaling  
  - Training with classification algorithms  
  - Hyperparameter tuning

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **scikit-learn** for model building  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover relationships between features and target variables.  
- Identified key indicators of heart disease, such as age, cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure.  
- Used classification models like:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  - **XGBoost**  
- Tuned hyperparameters to maximize accuracy and reduce overfitting.
